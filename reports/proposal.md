# Proposal

## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

- My role: Data scientists in the sports industry

- Target audience: Formula 1 fans interested in the 2022 race-calendar

Those who follow along with the world of Formula 1 motorsport will know it better than anyone: from the moment the season kicks of to the very last race the Formula 1 circus and all it's entourage is always moving. The races take place scattered over five different continents, and it gets difficult to follow along where they are, where they're going next, and what the next location will bring. As data scientists in the industry I'm looking to present the race calendar in a more fun and interactive way. Therefore my plan is to build an app where you can quickly see where all the tracks on the 2022 calendar are, where the next stop is, and a short summary of each location.

## Section 2: Description of Data

We will be visualizing Formula 1 race calendar with three different datasets:

The following dataset is extracted from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020).

- `circuits.csv` contains the location of all Formula 1 tracks raced on in the last decades.

The following dataset is extracted from [github](https://github.com/toUpperCase78/formula1-datasets)

- `formula1_2021season_calendar.csv` contains information on each of the 22 tracks used in 2021. Information about lap records, track dimensions, etc.

The track maps taken are extracted from [f1.com](https://www.formula1.com)

## Section 3: Research Questions and Usage Scenarios

Tom is an avid Formula 1 fan who wishes to explore in more detail where the 2022 Season of F1 races took place. He wants to be able to compare the different tracks on the calendar so he can get a better understanding of the differences between races, and he would like to get a better idea of where all the races are happening.

By clicking on a destination, Tom can [compare] the details of his favourite tracks to the next or previous on the calendar. By selecting the display route button, he can [explore] the entire order of races throughout the season, and he can understand better where the teams are headed, and where they came from.
